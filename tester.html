	<h3>Lodging</h3>

	<p>We have blocks of rooms reserved at two Arlington hotels at a discounted rate: the Courthouse Hilton and Inns of Virginia. We picked these hotels based on perceived convenience for our guests but you should feel free to stay wherever you would like. <a href="mailto:corinneandandy523@gmail.com">E-mail</a> us for a more personal recommendation. With advanced notice we may also be able to arrange home stays for those of you traveling from afar on limited budgets. If you live in the area and are willing to house guests, please let us know.</p>

	<h4>The Courthouse Hilton</h4>
	<p>The Hilton is located very close to Courthouse Metro on the Orange Line. It is also across the street from a lovely Saturday farmer's market and within walking distance of many bars and restaurants. A free shuttle to and from the wedding site will also be available for guests of the hotel. It is a short cab ride, a twenty-five minute walk, or a two-stop metro ride to Corinne's parents' house which is the venue for Friday night's reception. The cost per night is $129 plus taxes (around $145 total). To make a reservation in our room block follow <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/D/DCAARGI-GEW-20150522/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">this link</a>.</p>

	<h4>Inns of Virginia, Arlington</h4>
	<p>The Inns of Virginia is a budget-minded hotel that is just a twenty minute walk from the wedding venue. All the rooms have two queen-sized beds and there is free onsite parking. It is about a ten minute drive from Friday night's reception venue and a 1.5 mile walk from the metro. We have held ten rooms here for $89.99/night plus taxes (around $100 total). To make a reservation call (703) 524-9800 and let them know you are with the Gibbon/Eschbacher wedding party.

	<h3>Stuff to do in the area</h3>
	<p>Some people actually visit the Washington area for reasons other than our wedding. Here is a list of some of our favorite area pastimes/attractions.</p>

            If you bring a vehicle, we have lots of hikes to recommend in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Here are a couple of our favorite parks&mdash;feel free to contact us about specific hikes.
			<ul style="line-spacing: 2em;">
				<li>Andy Guest State Park &mdash; along the Shenandoah River with a range of hikes from easy to moderately difficult (<a href="./candaatandyguest.jpg">picture</a>)</li>
				<li>George Washington National Forest &mdash; Signal Knob</li>
				<li>Overall Run &amp; Heiskell Hollow &mdash; In Shenandoah National Park but through the backdoor so there is no entry fee. A beautiful hike with wonderful views and waterfalls. Can be difficult but is rewarding. ~12 miles in length.<br />
