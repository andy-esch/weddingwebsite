<!-- Weekend Schedule and Information -->

<div class="container" id="schedule">
    <h3>Schedule and Info</h3>
    <p><span class="highlight">All events will take place in Arlington, Virginia</span><br />
        The closest airport is Washington National (DCA). It is easily accessible to Arlington by public transit. Dulles (IAD) is the next best. It is about 45 minutes away by car or bus. Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) works, but it can take 1-2 hours to get to Arlington by car or 2+ hours by public transportation.</p>
    <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em;">Friday, May 22nd</p>
	<p>Please join us for an open house-style party that includes dinner and drinks at Corinne's parents' place: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/600+N+Kenmore+St,+Arlington,+VA+22201/@38.8792959,-77.099664,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7b69db2c7956d:0x5d32419c263cfe1e">600 N. Kenmore St. Arlington, VA</a>. We'll get things started around 6 pm.  Feel free to bring your kids to this event as well.</p>
    <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em;">Saturday, May 23rd</p>
	<p>Andy and Corinne will get married at <a href="http://parks.arlingtonva.us/locations/fort-cf-smith-park/">Fort C.F. Smith Park</a> followed by drinks, dinner, and dancing. We're getting a tent, so this is a rain-or-shine location. The ceremony will begin at <b>3:00 pm</b>. Due to Arlington County noise regulations, we will need to vacate the park by 10:00 pm. Due to a small venue capacity, we cannot accommodate kids at this event but feel free to contact us for babysitting recommendations.</p>
	<p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em;">Sunday, May 24th</p>
	<p>Please join us for a simple breakfast open house from 10 am to noon at Betty and Tom Gibbon's house: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/600+N+Kenmore+St,+Arlington,+VA+22201/@38.8792959,-77.099664,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7b69db2c7956d:0x5d32419c263cfe1e">600 N.

	<h3>Lodging</h3>

	<p>While there may be <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Arlington--VA--United-States?checkin=05%2F21%2F2015&checkout=05%2F24%2F2015&guests=2&source=bb">cheaper options out there</a>, we have blocks of rooms reserved at two Arlington hotels at a discounted rate: the Courthouse Hilton and Inns of Virginia. We picked these hotels based on perceived convenience for our guests but you should feel free to stay wherever you would like. <a href="mailto:corinneandandy523@gmail.com">E-mail</a> us for a more personal recommendation. With advanced notice we may also be able to arrange home stays for those of you traveling from afar on limited budgets. If you live in the area and are willing to house guests, please let us know.</p>

	<h4>The Courthouse Hilton</h4>
	<p>The Hilton is located very close to Courthouse Metro on the Orange Line. It is also across the street from a lovely Saturday farmer's market and within walking distance of many bars and restaurants. A free shuttle to and from the wedding site will also be available for guests of the hotel. It is a short cab ride, a twenty-five minute walk, or a two-stop metro ride to Corinne's parents' house, which is the venue for Friday night's reception. The cost per night is $129 plus taxes (around $145 total). To make a reservation in our room block, follow <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/D/DCAARGI-GEW-20150522/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">this link</a>.</p>

	<h4>Inns of Virginia, Arlington</h4>
	<p>The Inns of Virginia is a budget-minded hotel that is just a twenty minute walk from the wedding venue. All the rooms have two queen-sized beds and there is free onsite parking. It is about a ten minute drive from Friday night's reception venue and a 1.5 mile walk from the Metro. We have ten rooms held here for $89.99/night plus taxes (around $100 total), which is a discount of 10%. To make a reservation, call (703) 524-9800 and let them know you are with the Gibbon/Eschbacher wedding party to receive the discounted rate.

	<h3>Stuff to do in the area</h3>
	<img src="candaatandyguest.jpg" class="mainimage" title="Andy Guest State Park" />
	<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Some people actually visit the Washington area for reasons other than our wedding. Here is a list of some of our favorite area pastimes/attractions.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="highlight">Hiking</span><br />
            If you bring a vehicle, we have lots of hikes to recommend in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Here are a couple of our favorite places. Feel free to contact us about specific hikes.
			<ul style="line-spacing: 2em;">
				<li>Andy Guest State Park &mdash; along the Shenandoah River with a range of hikes from easy to moderately difficult</li>
				<li>George Washington National Forest &mdash; <a href="http://www.hikingupward.com/GWNF/SignalKnob/">Signal Knob</a> is a great moderately-difficult hike at about 10 miles in length.</li>
				<li>Overall Run &amp; Heiskell Hollow &mdash; In Shenandoah National Park but through the backdoor so there is no entry fee. A beautiful hike with wonderful views and waterfalls. Can be difficult but is rewarding. ~12 miles in length.<br />

<!-- FAQs -->

<div class="container" style="height: 100%" id="faqs">
<h3>FAQs</h3>

<p class="question">How should I plan on getting to and from the wedding site? Is there on-site parking?</p>

<p>There is parking on site for up to 70 vehicles. These vehicles can also be left in the parking lot overnight. We will provide shuttles from the wedding site to the <a href="http://innsofva.com/arlington.aspx">Inns of Virginia</a> and a local Metro stop. More information about the shuttles will come as we get closer to the event. If you are staying at the Hilton, shuttle service will be provided to and from the event. Again, check back later for more information.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take a taxi, we recommend <a href="http://www.redtopcab.com/">Red Top Cab</a>. Their number is: 703 522 3333.</p>

<p class="question">What's the dress code?</p>

<p>There isn't one. The bride will probably wear a dress and the groom is thinking about buying a second suit. We want you to feel comfortable above all else. The weather these days is anyone's guess, so we advise planning a versatile outfit. The venue is a public park so shirts and shoes would probably be encouraged by the county, but we couldn't find anything about that here: <a href="http://parks.arlingtonva.us/arlington-county-park-rules-regulations/">http://parks.arlingtonva.us/arlington-county-park-rules-regulations/</a></p>

<p class="question">Do you have a wedding registry?</p>

<p>Nope. We truly feel that your presence on our marriage journey, be it physical or spiritual, is the best gift you could give.</p>

<p class="question">What if I really, really want to get you a gift? What would you like?</p>

<p>If you really feel moved to give us something of a corporeal nature to mark the occasion, we've listed a few ideas below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Directions to your favorite hike (anywhere in the world&mdash;we'd love to go there!)</li>
	<li>A letter of relationship advice (we can read these when the going gets tough)</li>
	<li>A copy of your favorite poem</li>
	<li>An article about your favorite mathematical theorem, scientific idea, or dataset</li>
	<li>A mix CD of your top five favorite songs</li>
</ul>
