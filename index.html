        The closest airport is Washington National (DCA). It is easily accessible to Arlington by public transit. Dulles (IAD) is the next best. It is about 45 minutes away by car or bus. Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) works, but it can take 1-2 hours to get to Arlington by car or 2+ hours by public transportation.</p>

    <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em;">Friday, May 22nd</p>
    <p>Party in the evening/night for all guests at Corinne's parents' house. Feel free to bring your kids to this event as well. We're planning on dinner and drinks. Watch this site and expect more information with your invitation.

    <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em;">Saturday, May 23rd</p>
    <p>Andy and Corinne will get married at Fort C.F. Smith Park followed by drinks, dinner, and dancing. We're getting a tent so this is a rain or shine location. Ceremony will begin in the afternoon. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate kids at this event but feel free to contact us for babysitting recommendations.

	<h3>Lodging</h3>

	<p>We have blocks of rooms reserved at two Arlington hotels at a discounted rate: the Courthouse Hilton and Inns of Virginia. We picked these hotels based on perceived convenience for our guests but you should feel free to stay wherever you would like. <a href="mailto:corinneandandy523@gmail.com">E-mail</a> us for a more personal recommendation. With advanced notice we may also be able to arrange home stays for those of you traveling from afar on limited budgets. If you live in the area and are willing to house guests, please let us know.</p>

	<h4>The Courthouse Hilton</h4>
	<p>The Hilton is located very close to Courthouse Metro on the Orange Line. It is also across the street from a lovely Saturday farmer's market and within walking distance of many bars and restaurants. A free shuttle to and from the wedding site will also be available for guests of the hotel. It is a short cab ride, a twenty-five minute walk, or a two-stop metro ride to Corinne's parents' house, which is the venue for Friday night's reception. The cost per night is $129 plus taxes (around $145 total). To make a reservation in our room block follow <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/D/DCAARGI-GEW-20150522/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">this link</a>.</p>

	<h4>Inns of Virginia, Arlington</h4>
	<p>The Inns of Virginia is a budget-minded hotel that is just a twenty minute walk from the wedding venue. All the rooms have two queen-sized beds and there is free onsite parking. It is about a ten minute drive from Friday night's reception venue and a 1.5 mile walk from the Metro. We have held ten rooms here for $89.99/night plus taxes (around $100 total), which is a discount of 10%. To make a reservation call (703) 524-9800 and let them know you are with the Gibbon/Eschbacher wedding party to receive the discounted rate.
